üß™ About
This repository is part of a security research project focused on the detection, analysis, and prevention of cryptocurrency-targeting malware (commonly referred to as "crypto stealers"). The goal of this project is to better understand the techniques used by malicious actors in order to help develop more effective defenses.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer: This project is for educational and research purposes only. It does not contain or distribute any working malware, malicious binaries, or harmful code. All code and documentation here is designed to simulate or analyze malware behavior in a safe, controlled, and ethical manner.

üß≠ Objectives
Analyze common behavior patterns of crypto stealers

Document how wallets and clipboard hijacking are typically targeted

Provide detection heuristics and signatures (e.g. for antivirus engines or EDR tools)

Demonstrate safe simulation environments for malware behavior analysis (sandboxing, emulation)

Educate cybersecurity students and researchers

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools
Python (for analysis scripts)

YARA (for signature generation)

Cuckoo Sandbox / Flare VM (for dynamic analysis)

PCAP & memory dumps (for offline analysis)

üõ°Ô∏è Ethical Guidelines
We strictly follow responsible disclosure practices and do not promote the use, creation, or distribution of malware. Any samples or data used are either synthetic, redacted, or sourced from publicly available threat intelligence platforms under legal and ethical guidelines.
